# Resume Parsing API Integration

## Overview
This document explains how the resume parsing API has been integrated into the application according to the specified requirements.

## API Integration Details

### API Endpoint
- **URL**: `https://resume-parser-api-oxht.onrender.com/parse-resume`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: multipart/form-data
- **File Parameter**: `file`

### Integration Flow

1. **Upload Trigger**: When user uploads a resume and clicks Submit, the API is automatically called
2. **Data Processing**: The API response is processed and transformed into our application format
3. **UI Population**: Extracted fields are automatically populated in the UI
4. **Validation**: Mandatory fields are validated with visual indicators

## Implementation Files

### 1. API Services (`src/api/services.ts`)
- Added `ParsedResumeData` interface for API response structure
- Updated `ResumeUploadResponse` interface for enhanced data
- Implemented `parseResume()` function to call external API
- Enhanced `uploadResume()` function to use parsing API and transform data

### 2. Data Store (`src/store/candidateSlice.ts`)
- Extended `CandidateProfile` interface to include all extracted fields:
  - Personal info: name, email, phone (mandatory)
  - Links: linkedin, github, website (optional)
  - Education: array of institutions
  - Experience: array of work experiences with descriptions
  - Projects: array of projects with descriptions
  - Skills: array of skills

### 3. UI Component (`src/components/ResumeUpload.tsx`)
- Complete rewrite to display all extracted information
- Implemented mandatory field validation with red markers
- Added sections for all data types (personal, links, education, experience, projects, skills)
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

## Data Handling

### Mandatory Fields
The following fields are **required** and must be filled:
- **Name**: Full name from personal_info
- **Email**: Email address from personal_info  
- **Phone**: Phone number from personal_info

### Validation Rules
- If any mandatory field is missing or contains "not found", it's highlighted with red border
- Error alert is shown listing all missing mandatory fields
- Submit button is disabled until all mandatory fields are filled
- User cannot proceed to interview until validation passes

### Missing Data Handling
- Fields containing "not found" are treated as empty but field labels remain visible
- Optional fields (LinkedIn, GitHub, Website) are only shown if data exists
- Sections (Education, Experience, Projects, Skills) are only rendered if data exists
- Skills array filters out "not found" entries automatically

## UI Display Structure

### 1. Personal Information (Required)
- Name (with user icon)
- Email (with mail icon)  
- Phone (with phone icon)
- Red borders and error messages for missing mandatory fields

### 2. Links (Optional)
- LinkedIn profile URL
- GitHub profile URL
- Personal website URL
- Only displayed if data is available

### 3. Education
- Institution names displayed in cards
- Only shown if education data exists

### 4. Experience  
- Company/position title with date range
- Bullet-pointed description lists
- Displayed in expandable cards

### 5. Projects
- Project titles
- Bullet-pointed description lists
- Displayed in cards format

### 6. Skills
- Displayed as colored tags
- Filters out "not found" entries
- Only shown if valid skills exist

## Error Handling

### API Errors
- Network failures show generic "Failed to process resume" message
- Specific API errors are displayed to user
- Upload process can be retried

### Validation Errors
- Missing mandatory fields trigger warning message
- Individual field validation with visual indicators
- Form submission blocked until validation passes
- Clear error messages guide user to required actions

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Upload a PDF or DOCX resume file
2. Verify API call is made to parsing endpoint
3. Check that extracted data appears in UI
4. Verify mandatory field validation works
5. Test form submission with complete data
6. Verify "Start Interview" button appears when profile is complete

### Test Scenarios
- Resume with all fields populated
- Resume with missing phone number (most common)
- Resume with missing name or email (validation test)
- Invalid file types (should be rejected)
- Network errors during API call
- Malformed API responses

## Sample API Response Structure
```json
{
  "personal_info": {
    "name": "THUMULA VAMSHIDHAR RAO",
    "email": "thumulavamshidhar@gmail.com",
    "phone": "not found",
    "linkedin": "linkedin (found in email but actual LinkedIn link is missing)",
    "github": "not found",
    "website": "not found"
  },
  "other_info": {
    "education": [
      {
        "institution": "Vellore Institute of Technology Vellore, Tamil Nadu"
      }
    ],
    "experience": [
      {
        "key": "Intern â€“ Ebani Tech Pvt. Ltd.",
        "start": "June 2024",
        "end": "not found",
        "description": ["Description text here..."]
      }
    ],
    "projects": [
      {
        "title": "Customer Churn Analysis and Data Pipeline",
        "description": ["Project description here..."]
      }
    ],
    "extra_info": {
      "skills": ["Programming Languages", "not found", "Databases & Cloud"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Automatic Data Extraction**: Users don't need to manually enter information
2. **Smart Validation**: Only mandatory fields are enforced
3. **Clean UI**: "not found" values are handled gracefully
4. **Comprehensive Display**: All available information is shown in organized sections
5. **Error Prevention**: Users can't proceed without completing required fields
6. **Professional Appearance**: Information is displayed in well-formatted cards and sections

## Future Enhancements

- Add edit capabilities for extracted information
- Implement confidence scores for extracted data
- Add support for additional file formats
- Cache parsed results to avoid re-parsing
- Add batch upload functionality
