# Interview Flow Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Completed Implementation**

### **1. Hardcoded 6 Questions**
- **Easy 1**: Tell me about yourself and your background in software development (2 minutes)
- **Easy 2**: What programming languages are you most comfortable with and why? (2 minutes)
- **Medium 1**: Describe a challenging project you worked on. What was your approach? (3 minutes)
- **Medium 2**: Explain synchronous vs asynchronous programming with examples (3 minutes)
- **Hard 1**: Design a social media platform architecture for millions of users (5 minutes)
- **Hard 2**: Walk through web application performance optimization techniques (5 minutes)

### **2. Mock API Implementation**
- **Start Interview API**: Returns first question, initializes localStorage session
- **Submit Answer API**: Stores answers, moves to next question, handles completion
- **Local Storage**: Temporary storage for interview sessions and answers
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Hardcoded scoring based on answer length, time taken, and difficulty

### **3. Interview Flow Control**
- ✅ **Exactly 6 Questions**: Interview stops automatically after 6th question
- ✅ **One Question at a Time**: Sequential flow through all questions
- ✅ **Answer Storage**: All answers stored in localStorage with timestamps
- ✅ **Automatic Completion**: Interview ends when all 6 questions are answered
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Accurate question counter (1/6, 2/6, etc.)

### **4. UI Improvements**
- **Start Screen**: Clear instructions about 6 questions (2 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard)
- **Question Display**: Shows difficulty level, question number, and timer
- **Progress Indicators**: 
  - Circular timer with countdown
  - Linear progress bar showing completed questions
  - Question counter in header
- **Completion Screen**: Shows final score and detailed breakdown

### **5. Fixed Issues**
- ❌ **"18 of 6 completed" bug**: Fixed by using proper question counting
- ✅ **Prevents overrun**: Interview cannot continue beyond 6 questions
- ✅ **Accurate progress**: Progress bars and counters show correct values
- ✅ **Clean completion**: Interview ends immediately after 6th question

## **How It Works**

### **Interview Start**
1. User clicks "Start Interview" 
2. API creates new localStorage session
3. First question (Easy 1) is displayed
4. Timer starts (2 minutes for Easy questions)

### **Question Flow**
1. User answers and submits (or timer expires)
2. Answer stored in localStorage with metadata
3. Next question loaded automatically
4. Progress indicators updated
5. Process repeats for all 6 questions

### **Interview Completion**
1. After 6th question submission, interview automatically completes
2. Score calculated based on:
   - Answer length and quality
   - Time taken vs time limit
   - Question difficulty multipliers
3. Completion screen shows:
   - Final score out of 100
   - Detailed breakdown per question
   - Interview summary

### **Scoring Logic**
- **Easy Questions**: Max 20 points each, based on word count × 0.5
- **Medium Questions**: Max 30 points each, based on word count × 0.4  
- **Hard Questions**: Max 50 points each, based on word count × 0.3
- **Time Bonus/Penalty**:
  - Too quick (< 50% time): 80% of score
  - Almost full time (> 90%): 90% of score
  - Optimal range: Full score

## **Local Storage Structure**
```json
{
  "interview_candidateId": {
    "candidateId": "candidate_123",
    "currentQuestionIndex": 0,
    "answers": [
      {
        "questionIndex": 0,
        "question": "Tell me about yourself...",
        "answer": "I am a software developer...",
        "timeTaken": 95,
        "timestamp": "2025-09-30T..."
      }
    ],
    "isComplete": false,
    "startedAt": "2025-09-30T..."
  }
}
```

## **API Ready for Integration**

When real APIs are available, simply replace the mock functions in `src/api/services.ts`:

### **Start Interview API**
```typescript
// Replace: 
const session = createNewSession(candidateId);
// With:
const response = await apiClient.post(`/api/candidates/${candidateId}/start`);
```

### **Submit Answer API**
```typescript
// Replace localStorage logic with:
const response = await apiClient.post(`/api/candidates/${candidateId}/answer`, formData);
```

### **Scoring API**
Add new endpoint for scoring:
```typescript
export const calculateInterviewScore = async (candidateId: string) => {
  const response = await apiClient.post(`/api/candidates/${candidateId}/score`);
  return response.data;
};
```

## **Testing Instructions**

1. **Upload Resume**: Complete the resume upload process first
2. **Start Interview**: Click "Start Interview" button  
3. **Answer Questions**: 
   - Type answers in the text area
   - Watch the timer countdown
   - Submit before time expires or it auto-submits
4. **Verify Flow**:
   - Exactly 6 questions are presented
   - Progress indicators work correctly
   - Interview stops after question 6
5. **Check Completion**:
   - Score is calculated and displayed
   - Interview summary is shown
   - Cannot continue beyond 6 questions

## **Browser Console Debugging**

The implementation includes extensive logging for testing:
- Interview start/initialization
- Question loading and transitions  
- Answer submission responses
- Completion logic
- Score calculation details

Check browser console (F12) for detailed flow information during testing.
